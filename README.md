# My Boston University Website/Blog

I used to have a blog during my undergraduate years at [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu). It's been taken down for several years now, for some reason. I had to use [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to retrieve what was cached.

There are two html files to look at: index.html and old_index.html. The old_index represents what my blog looked like before I graduated. index I rebuilt a few years after graduating from BU, before going to Depaul University for my master's.

Original URL: [cs-people.bu.edu/spong](http://cs-people.bu.edu/spong) - No longer works.
